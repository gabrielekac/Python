# OOP:
# 6.Create a base class named Vehicle that has the following attributes: 
# make, model, and year. It should also have a method called get_info() that 
# returns a string with the vehicle's make, model, and year.
#  Then create two subclasses, Car and Truck, that inherit from Vehicle and
#  add additional attributes and methods specific to each type of vehicle.
