# OOP:
# 7.Create a base class named Person that has the following attributes: 
# name, age, and address. It should also have a method called get_info() that 
# returns a string with the person's name, age, and address. 
# Then create two subclasses, Student and Teacher, that inherit from Person and 
# add additional attributes and methods specific to each role.
